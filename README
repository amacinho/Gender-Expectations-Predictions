This document contains the corpus-based predictions of gender expectations of more than 20.000 actions that are represented in ConceptNet. Currently, there are two predictions: Twitter-based (twitter.txt) and Web-based (ukwac.txt). For details consult the references at the end.

Both files have the same format: Each line consists of 4 tab-seperated fields, action, male count, female count, normalized score. Male and female counts correspond to the number of male and female utterances of the action either in a Twitter-based or Web-based corpus. The normalized score is a z-normalization based on a binomial assumption of male and female utterances with p equal to ratio of overall male utterances to the all utterances.
